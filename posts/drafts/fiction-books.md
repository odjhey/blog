Fiction Books

Recently started reading some "proper" fiction books recommended by an online friend. 
Last I read one was way back when I got a copy of one of the books from the Eragon series.

Initial thoughts, the words are difficult, the descriptions, mad intricate and very detailed, a little bit hard for me. But it gets easy.
It probably does not help that it's not a book I would pick myself, hence the unfamiliarity with the pool of adjectives and nouns being used, but after a few chapters, after painting the story setting with tones of adjectives, the reading gets easier.

Im more accustomed to reading proses that describe "events" rather than painting like wall of texts that builds a world.
The early chapters did the setup, the painting, following chapters are for the events, where it got me excited.
