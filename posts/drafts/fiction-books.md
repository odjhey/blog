Fiction Books

Recently started reading some "proper" fiction books recommended by a friend. 
Last I read one was way back when I got a copy of one of the books from the Eragon series.

Initial thoughts, the words are difficult, the descriptions, mad intricate and very detailed, a little bit hard for me. 
But it gets easy. Difficulty at the start is highly likely because it's a book I would normally not pick myself, hence the unfamiliarity with the pool of adjectives and nouns used. After a few chapters though, after painting the story setting with tonnes of adjectives, reading gets easier.

Im more accustomed to reading proses of "events", descriptions of actions taken and the reasoning behind, rather than reading a painting like wall of texts that tries to build a world.

The early chapters did the setup, the painting, following chapters are for what transpired in em, the events, this is where i got real excited.
