What do I do.

I mostly read, read plain texts, edit plain texts, create plain texts.
Currently, im in this rabbit hole of tidying my `init.el` and `init.vim`.

For those who doesn't get it. It's this jurassic text editors, called emacs and vim.

~ body ~ insert more here.

End.

Next time, we'll talk about Stow.
I work on multiple machines, local machines, remote machines.
Stow is sane way to manage cross-machine configs.
