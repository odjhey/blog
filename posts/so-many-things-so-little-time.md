Is it though?

On top of my head, here is a quick list of things I want to do.

- Be productive at work
- Create a youtube channel about my favorite games
- Write a blog ( -- we'll, atleast I was able to start this now )
- Get better at playing the Acoustic Guitar
- Go through my game stash and at-least complete some

* Deploy a solution using the `ELK` stack!
* Run `kubernetes` in PRD ( -- though honestly, our products are so small that i'm still very happy with `docker-compose`)
