Ordinary.

Let me preface this with

_"There is nothing wrong with the ordinary."_

Many are content with a simple ordinary life, but ordinary may sometimes not always translate to easier, a famous quote goes;

> _Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the *mediocre*. The level of competition is thus fiercest for 'realistic' goals, paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming.”_ <div style="text-align: right; "><small>_Timothy Ferriss_</small></div>

Nothing's wrong with wanting a mundane uneventful life, as the Japanese also have the saying

> _hosoku nagaku ikiru (細く長く生きる, live long and inconspicuously)_

Find your happiness.
