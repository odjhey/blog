A Promise Neverland x Monster Hunting feels kind of anime.

We also get a mix of Made in Abyss type of vibe from this one.

Promise Neverland for the man-eating and mystery of the outside aspect, while Made in Abyss for the monster randoms, and Monster Hunting RPG for the way one of the chars fight, pattern recognition then trial repeat, MH in Diablo's hardcore mode.

Do note I am still at Episode 2 so not really sure about how this progresses.
