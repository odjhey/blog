### SUPER DRAFT

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/

So I bit the bullet, sat down @6PM after office, paid some items in my steam cart, then played for 7 straight hours. I beat the first tower, explored, then called it a day.

Initial thoughts, **I am too old for this**, IDK y, but the experience felt lacking,
i think i mainly want 2 things, among others.

1. More influence of my Pals in battle, more strategy?
1. More options, ways to finetune, resource gathering at the base.

Again, i merely played 7hours, so for sure I have missed a lot. But in general, the combat and resource gathering aspect, which are the aspects I was looking forward about, left me lacking.

### Combat

Do i raise my pals? How?
4 pals, rotate when dieing,they gain some HP while out of combat.
It pains me to think that the gameplay loop is only about dropping your pals and bringing out your guns.
I want more control and influence over the combat.
like

1. need more equip slots for pals? more Pal passives perhaps, conditional passive triggers?

### Base Building

Resource gathering

1. can we make simple machines to automate?
1. efficiency route, correct pals and correct traits?
1. non base centric farms?

Again, these are mostly my initial thoughts of the game, but I don't see myself picking it up soon. After a year perhaps?

Do I need to relog and try breeding?

In general, my questions are, how does creativity and strategy influence your play style?
