```elixir
{:ok, payload} = someAction()
# OR
{:error, info} = someAction()
```

Why is the above construct NOT as common in other languages? Hmmm, maybe they are, i might just be unaware.

Above or something akin to the _Railway Oriented Programming (ROP)_ would be a real neat addition to your project's conventions.

There is a lot of things I like about Elixir, you know, OTP and stuff.
And when working on non-elixir projects,
I often find myself looking-for/reimplementing some very simple things that are second nature when on ElixirLand.

(1) One of them would be what is shown above; and  
 (2) another would be `Ecto`'s `changesets`.

I'll leave them details to your googling skills, but i'd like to add that it is also somewhat similar to
the spirit of the `Parse, donâ€™t validate` mantra, which I first encountered from
`colinhacks/zod`'s [readme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) referencing this [article](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/).
go take a read.
