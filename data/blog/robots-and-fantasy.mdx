I loled hard when I saw this, an LOL with anticipation and giddiness. Imagine how I felt when I first saw the tags in my feed, marrying my trash Isekai taste and some form of programming? just like the Shield Hero experience all over again, hope it stands or at least be on par my very low and shallow expectations haha. Currently at episode 2, still 50/50 whether a boo or a yay.

#### Footnotes

- A more sophisticated, and or more simple and streamlined IO interface for the pilot controls would'be been more mind blowing. That was an opportunity missed.
- Wait, I think I've already seen this one ðŸ¤£, the episode where they are repairing the broken Red Mech is bringing the memories back.
