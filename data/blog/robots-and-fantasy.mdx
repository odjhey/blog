I loled hard when I saw this one, an LOL with anticipation and giddiness. Imagine marrying my trash Isekai taste and some form of programming, this is just like the Shield Hero all over again, hope it stands or at least be on par what with my low expectations. Currently at episode 2, still 50/50 whether a boo or a yay.
