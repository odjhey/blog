### Draft

I am a fan of typescript, clojurescript, fennel, and some other languages that does this thing the three langs mentioned have in common. What is it? Yep,
they are languages that targets some other language's runtime. I feel that currently, it is the advent of these types of languages. Now, the title of this is a peek into
the future, what that does mean. I recently been reading and watching the development of rec-lang, and bumped into this new young lang called pen (see refs), it was
greatly explained by Richard Fieldman in this talk (https://youtu.be/cpQwtwVKAfU?t=756), roc-lang is currently calling it platform, and pen-lang calls it system-injection.
Now, these languages are in early development so im sure things may change and the two concepts are not entirely the same, but the thing
that i want to point here is that we started with low level langs that targets hardware instructions, to using VMs, as in like JVM/BEAM/V8, to this higher abstraction than
a runtime VM. so my guess is ... ... ... ...
