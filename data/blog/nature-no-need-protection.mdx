Yes, nature no need protection, it will be what it needs to be, whether a form that is human survival friendly or otherwise.
The argument here is that we, as people, need to infuence natures evolution, to point towards somewhere that is good for us.

We have to get down our high horses, and realize, we're not some knights-in-shinning-armours, doing nature a favor, by protecting it.
We are at the mercy of nature, and for our own sake, we have to acknowledge, that instead of protect, we need to influence, for it to grow to a direction that iz good for hoomans.
