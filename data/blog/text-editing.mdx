What do I do?

I mostly read, read plain texts, edit plain texts, create plain texts.
Currently, im in this rabbit hole of tidying my `init.el` and `init.vim`.

For those who don't get it. Above are config files for these jurassic,
but still prevalent, text editors, called `emacs` and `vim`.

~ body ~ insert more here.

End.

Next time, we'll talk about Stow.
I work on multiple machines, local machines, remote machines.
Stow is a sane way to manage our cross-machine configs.
