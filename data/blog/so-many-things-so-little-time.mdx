Do I?

On top of my head, here is a quick list of things I want to do.

- Ship that feature for work.
- Start that youtube channel about games.
- Write a blog ( -- well, tf you think you're reading )
- Get better at playing the Acoustic Guitar
- Go through my game stash and atleast complete some

* Deploy a solution using the `ELK` stack!
* Run `kubernetes` in PRD ( -- though honestly, my projects are so small i'm still happy with `compose`)

Above list is more like `head wanttodo.txt` haha.

It's getting harder to focus. Gone are those days when I can pick and complete one. My time is spread so thinly progress cannot be seen. Hope to be able to audit and sell soon.

End.
