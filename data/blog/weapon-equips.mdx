So we got some time, so started distracting myself with the new Trigun, it reminded me about the fascination with weapons,
beat the vandel buster, trigun, guilty crown, and many more who rock cool weapons, i should probably revisit these, oh, lets not forget the ko-gan-anki

Wolfwood and Vash always look cool no matter how many times i see them, no matter how many decades has it been, no matter how many decades has passed.
