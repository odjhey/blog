So we got some time, and started distracting myself with the new [Trigun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigun_Stampede), it reminded me about the old fascination with weapons,
beet the vandel buster, trigun, guilty crown, and many more who rock cool equips, i should probably revisit these, oh, lets not forget the ko-gan-anki

Wolfwood and Vash always look cool no matter how many times i see them, no matter how many decades has it been, no matter how many decades has passed.
