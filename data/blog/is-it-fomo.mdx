FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

Hmmmm. FOMO? or I've yet to find my standards?

Deadlines are tomorrow, still have 8 features to test and build.
You see me typing. It's 3AM, You see cans of cola on the table, half full, some un-touched, cups of coffee.
You expect me to be crunching and typing some gibber to be able to ship.

You took a peek, you're wrong. I'm doing something else.

Yes I am coding, but I am not working. You see, I found an article online on how to
implement this shiny new thing in javascript.
You thought, ahh maybe he's doing something different for some change of pace and will continue to work on our features in a few.
Teeet, again, wrong. You see, I've been on this for a week now, an interesting library was mentioned from one of the videos... conference I watched earlier. I'm planning to do that next.

I know. This is how my life goes. I always tell myself it will help me grow, and this will help me do my job better. haha. bs. This is procrastination, i'm describing you mine at it's best.
