Leverage the following

1. memory hooks
1. SRS <- lol, but really one must forget, or almost forget haha
1. learn like layering/sculpting, make the shape, broad strokes, before details, hmmm we don't learn specific concepts in a specific order? we learn in broad strokes most of the time, then alot focused sessions as needed.
1. just be consistent, have the habit

For more specific stuff

1. learn how to recognize kanji, no need exact meanings at the start, just make sure to learn how to recognize the overall shape.
1. for meaning and reading, rinse and repeat furiganas in the wild, immerse, rinse repeat, and hope it sticks :P

Make sure to journal, where you at, what you think your level is, what you dont know, consistently log, you'll be surprised by your progress in the future, you'll be surprised how far you have gotten, you have to journal
