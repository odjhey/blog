I bought a camera on impulse during the lock down, around the end of 2020. Haven't held it until recently, intending to take portraits, so went on, clicked them buttons,
got home, rendered, and then it hit me, they, for lack of a better word, kinda suck, how to make these better?

With the quest to improve them portraits, i went to the netz, looked about the whats and hows of photography,
fascination and intrigue cloaked me, a few hours later in the rabbit hole, I got hooked, got hooked by a topic, by the concept of photo composition.

what is composition?

with the help of youtubes, below is a summary of what i have gathered so far,
this blog entry also serves as a reference whenever I get stuck on how to progress,

# Composition

> what is in the frame, where is it located.

not sure what is it yet, but from above, i understand it means "framing a subject, and the setting". As someone famous also said

> What you put in the frame determines the photograph. <small>Joel Meyerowitz</small>

He went on and continued to mention about what you put in and what you decide leave out determines the photo. I highly suggest we go and rewatch that episode.

So composition is essentially the concept of where and what we put in a frame. Along this definition, below are notes from some of the videos about composition that i find useful

1. take away as much as you can, focus on a subject, have a dominant subject
1. introduce depth, have a background, foreground, midground, control these by adjusting your aperture, by applying blur (also related, headrooms)
1. use the rule of thirds - subject on the crossings, above or below the lines
1. balance
   - care with negative and dead space, i find this valid with stills
   - i find that negative space is wanted in places like subjects intending to do action, have space in the direction of action (related, leading/looking room)
1. leading lines, unsure if this is under geometry, but separating as i feel their is much more to understand here
1. geometry, patterns, repetitions
1. symmetry - their is beauty in symmetry (and asymmetry)
1. fill the frame, for stills, fill the frame
1. framing/frame within frame - also look for "non-frame" frames like colors, shadows, etc
1. use contrast
1. use shadows
1. break the rules

Above is a list of things i thought should be recorded, will update them as we learn more about composing our photos.

During the search, several photography topics were also touched on, and not knowing where to fit them, i decided to continue below

## Elements/Building Blocks

### shape

The outline of the object, length, width.
Shape creates balance and harmony.
Try the easy hack of squinting or defocusing the lens, you'll for sure see shapes.

### form

depth, dimension, to look real, to look 3d rather than flat. Enhance form and shape to introduce depth.
Introduce form through lighting, use light and shadow to give a sense of volume.

### texture

This elevates the surface detail, makes you able to connect with it, touch it.
Our brain makes a connection based on how things feel like.
Emphasize by making the light skid along the surface, thats why golden hour photos has dem nice effects.

### light

Warm light normally mean calm, direct light is to dramatic and intense mood.
Pay attention to the quality, intensity, direction, the color of light in the scene.

### color

Separates your subject, makes subjects pop, used to show more of previous building blocks.

### mood

Not sure.

embrace imperfections - shown in Ernst Haas works

## Why i think i started

take photos to tell a story, show the world a face of a state of a fragment in time in a bounded miniscule space, to not forget.
I just want to photograph mundane stuff, portraits, the streets, what happens in the streets.

> Am I a photographer now? No, I would like to think that I am someone who just wants to show a story
